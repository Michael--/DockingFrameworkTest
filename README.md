====================

This project is existing to comile and run the DockingFramework and also the DockingFrameworkExamples.
There are only some basic components which only are not enough to show a meaningful application.

It exist a large application with a lot of components, but because these components are confidential its currently not possible to present weighty examples.

With the DockingFramework as base, together with some other simple rules, its easy to unite development by multitude of developer and also some more user of the product it itself.

The product is running in house and at some customer as well. It will be used with Windows and Linux. Mac OS is also possible (with limits).
